# cadquery2web

You know when you want to generate a [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) STL file and print it at work, but you can't import CadQuery on your work laptop? Run it on your server at home and have a web based interface to view the model, and download the STL.

See a live instance at [cad.30hours.dev](http://cad.30hours.dev).

## Usage

- Run the containers using `docker-compose`:

  ```
  sudo docker compose up -d
  ```

- Navigate to [localhost:49157](http://localhost:49157) to start creating.

## Operation

The software consists of 3 containers:

- **web** runs the front-end. This is HTML/CSS/JavaScript that allows CadQuery code to be input, shows the current 3D model (coarse) with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and allows requesting an STL to be generated from the server and downloaded. 

- **node** runs a Node.js server to handle requests from the user (geometry and STL requests) and serve these back to the client. It implements a queue to process requests for simultaneous users.

- **cadquery** runs the CadQuery server in Python. The CadQuery server has security controls to ensure only CadQuery code can be executed, to prevent remote code execution and privilege escalation (see the [CadQuery Dockerfile](./cadquery/Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for details). Strict whitelisting on the imports and functions that can be executed has been implemented in [CadQueryValidator.py](./cadquery/CadQueryValidator.py).

  Once code passes the validator, the shape undergoes coarse tesselation into vertices and faces. This data is passed back to the web front-end for display. An STL file can then be generated for the high resolution model.

## Notes

- See [CadQuery examples](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) for code that can be run directly.
- Loosely based on [replicad](https://github.com/sgenoud/replicad) but using CadQuery instead of [OpenCascade.js](https://ocjs.org/).
- Pull requests are very welcome.
